PHP
====

``FxcmRest`` is a library for event-driven trading with FXCM over RestAPI using ``ReactPHP``.

Requirements
------------

  PHP 7.0.2+

Installation
------------

The recommended way to install FxcmRest is through `Composer <https://getcomposer.org/>`_.

This command will install the latest stable version:

::

	$ composer require fxcm/fxcmrest


Usage
-----

As FXCM Rest API requires you to keep Socket.IO connection open through the whole time it is used, this library must be run within a php script and not as part of php generated website.

Interaction can be done either by using a console or through HTTP requests handled directly by the php script for example with ``\React\HTTP``.

Main class of the library is ``\FxcmRest\FxcmRest``. It must be instantiated with two objects:

	* ``\React\EventLoop\LoopInterface``
	* ``\FxcmRest\Config``

Configuration class ``\FxcmRest\Config`` must be instantiated with an array containing at least the two following parameters:

	* ``host``
	* ``token``

Configuration Parameters
------------------------
	* ``protocol`` - either ``\FxcmRest\Protocol::HTTPS`` (default) or ``\FxcmRest\Protocol::HTTP``
	* ``host`` - either ``api.fxcm.com`` for Real accounts or ``api-demo.fxcm.com`` for Demo accounts
 	* ``port`` - port number. ``443`` default
 	* ``token`` - 40 char hexadecimal string

Functions
---------
.. code-block:: php

	connect() : null

1. Opens a connection to the server. When connection is complete, ``connected`` signal will be emitted.

.. code-block:: php

	disconnect() : null

2. Disconnects from the server. When disconnection is complete, ``disconnected`` signal will be emitted. 

.. code-block:: php

	socketID() : string

3. If connected to the server, returns a string representing the socketID. If not connected, returns an empty string.

.. code-block:: php

	request(\FxcmRest\HttpMethod $method, string $path, array $arguments, callable $callback) : null

4. Sends a http request to the server. When request is completed, ``$callback`` will be called with two parameters:

	* ``int`` representing HTTP status code. 200 for OK
	* ``string`` representing server answer body

.. code-block:: Java

	on(string $signalName, callable $callback) : null

5. Registers a ``$callback`` for a signal of ``$signalName``. For a list of signals and parameters that are passed with them please see **Signals** section.
 
Signals
-------
1. ``connected`` - Emitted when connection sequence is complete. After this socketID is valid and requests can be sent to the server. No parameters are passed.

2. ``disconnected`` - Emitted when connection to the server is closed. No parameters are passed.

3. ``error`` - Emitted on errors. Passes error description as string.

4. ``[Offer,OpenPosition,ClosedPosition,Account,Summary,Properties]`` - Emmited on trading table changes. Passes table update contents as JSON string. Requires subscription through ``/trading/subscribe``

5. ``(EUR/USD,EUR/GBP,...)`` - Emmited on price update. Passes the price update as a JSON string. Requires subscription through ``/subscribe``.

PHP Sample Code
---------------

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

    $loop = \React\EventLoop\Factory::create();

    $config = new \FxcmRest\Config([
        'host' => 'api-demo.fxcm.com',
        'token' => 'YOUR_TOKEN',
    ]);

    $counter = 0;
    $rest = new \FxcmRest\FxcmRest($loop, $config);
    $rest->on('connected', function() use ($rest,&$counter) {
        $rest->request('POST', '/subscribe',
            ['pairs' => 'EUR/USD'],
            function($code, $data) use ($rest,&$counter) {
                if($code === 200) {
                    $rest->on('EUR/USD', function($data) use ($rest,&$counter) {
                        echo "price update: {$data}\n";
                        $counter++;
                        if($counter === 5){
                            $rest->disconnect();
                        }
                    });
                }
            }
        );
    });
    $rest->on('error', function($e) use ($loop) {
        echo "socket error: {$e}\n";
        $loop->stop();
    });
    $rest->on('disconnected', function() use ($loop) {
        echo "FxcmRest disconnected\n";
        $loop->stop();
    });
    $rest->connect();

    $loop->run();
    ?>

Details
-------

This API exposes the methods of the REST API as a class, dealing with all of the common tasks 
involved with setting up connections and wiring callback listeners for you. In addition to that
there are a few convenience methods. 

A quick example is as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    import fxcm_rest_api_token
    import time
    trader = fxcm_rest_api_token.Trader('YOURTOKEN', 'prod')
    trader.login()

    #### Open Market Order
    # query account details and use the first account found
    accounts = trader.get_model("Account")
    account_id = accounts['accounts'][0]['accountId']
    # Open 10 lots on USD/JPY for the first account_id found.
    response = trader.open_trade(account_id, "USD/JPY", True, 10)
    if response['status']:
    # close all USD/JPY trades.
      response = trader.close_all_for_symbol("USD/JPY")

    #### Historical Data request
    basic = trader.candles("USD/JPY", "m1", 5)
    print(basic)
    date_fmt = trader.candles("USD/JPY", "m1", 5, dt_fmt="%Y/%m/%d %H:%M:%S")
    print(date_fmt)
    date_fmt_headers = trader.candles_as_dict("USD/JPY", "m1", 3, dt_fmt="%Y/%m/%d %H:%M:%S")
    print(date_fmt_headers)
    ##### Price subscriptions
    subscription_result = trader.subscribe_symbol("USD/JPY")

    # Define alternative price update handler and supply that.
    def pupdate(msg):
        print("Price update: ", msg)
    subscription_result = trader.subscribe_symbol("USD/JPY", pupdate)
    counter = 1
    while counter < 60:
        time.sleep(1)
        counter += 1 
  
Candles
-------

All calls to candles allow either ``instrument name``, or ``offerId``. They also allow the ``From`` and ``To`` to be specified as timestamp or a date/time format that will be interpreted ("2017/08/01 10:00", "Aug 1, 2017 10:00", etc.).
In addition to ``instrument_id``, ``response``, ``period_id`` and ``candles``, a ``headers`` field (not documented in the API notes) is returned, representing the candle fields.

``basic``

        print item
